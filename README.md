## Background ðŸ”Ž
---

A concert venue was looking to add addtional concerts to their line-up for the oncoming concert year. In order to generate more revenue, they are interested in adding artists whose 
genres have high rates of attendance so they can maximize the money made from ticket, parking, and concessions. After looking over their attendance rates for the last two years, they
are wanting to add either country or rock genre artists to their line-up. The concert venue would like this project to focus on looking into the differences in attendance and revenue 
for rock and country artists from the last three years.
